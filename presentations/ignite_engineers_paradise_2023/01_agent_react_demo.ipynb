    "# Agent Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Demo we are going to show how to use the ReACT agent to answer questions about a rock band.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal of this code is to showcase use case of [Intelligent Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/) capable of reading DuckDuckGo search results to properly answer questions about different topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code bellow makes use of the following software:\n",
    " - [langchain](https://www.langchain.com) - a library for building language chains\n",
    " - [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) - a language model API\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent is a implementation makes use of the [ReAct Prompting](https://react-lm.github.io) algorithm. A ReAct prompt consists of few-shot task-solving trajectories, with human-written text reasoning traces and actions, as well as environment observations in response to actions. \n",
    "\n",
