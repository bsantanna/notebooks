Italy,Nicosia 2013 Vulkà Bianco  (Etna),"Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimstone and dried herb. The palate isn't overly expressive, offering unripened apple, citrus and dried sage alongside brisk acidity.",White Blend,Nicosia
Portugal,Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro),"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.",Portuguese Red,Quinta dos Avidagos
US,Rainstorm 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented.",Pinot Gris,Rainstorm
Spain,Tandem 2011 Ars In Vitro Tempranillo-Merlot (Navarra),"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.",Tempranillo-Merlot,Tandem
France,Trimbach 2012 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This dry and restrained wine offers spice in profusion. Balanced with acidity and a firm texture, it's very much for food.",Gewürztraminer,Trimbach
Germany,Heinz Eifel 2013 Shine Gewürztraminer (Rheinhessen),"Savory dried thyme notes accent sunnier flavors of preserved peach in this brisk, off-dry wine. It's fruity and fresh, with an elegant, sprightly footprint.",Gewürztraminer,Heinz Eifel
Argentina,Felix Lavaque 2010 Felix Malbec (Cafayate),"Baked plum, molasses, balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity. A compact set of saucy red-berry and plum flavors features tobacco and peppery accents, while the finish is mildly green in flavor, with respectable weight and balance.",Malbec,Felix Lavaque
Chile,Estampa 2011 Estate Viognier-Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"White flower, lychee and apple aromas carry the mellow bouquet. The chunky-feeling palate bears powdery, sweet flavors of peach and melon, mixed with greener notes of grass and lime. The 80% Viognier component is typical of the warm climate: plump and oily, with a short finish. Chardonnay fills out the blend.",Viognier-Chardonnay,Estampa
Australia,Yalumba 2016 Made With Organic Grapes Chardonnay (South Australia),"This medium-bodied Chardonnay features aromas of pineapple and roasted cashew. Similar notes of ripe pineapple and nuts mark the palate, then ease to a rather soft, easy finish. Drink now.",Chardonnay,Yalumba
Austria,Fuchs 2015 Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland),"Freshness characterizes the nose: green pear, ivy leaves and citrus notes play on nose and palate. This is light footed, easy drinking and charming. Drink soon while flavors are fresh.",Grüner Veltliner,Fuchs
