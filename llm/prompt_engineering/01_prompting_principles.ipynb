      "Patience is a virtue. Resilience is a trait you acquire through hard work. Both are essential to human nature. To better understand patience, consider the paradox: Perseverance is often harder than the initial attempt. Patience allows you to wait for what's to come; it also allows you to be comfortable with uncertainty. The more you practice patience, the easier it becomes. Resilience, on the other hand, is something that can be cultivated. Consider also: In sports, the best athletes always learn from their failures, and never quit when things get difficult. Resilience is a hard-willed quality, and requires you to be unafraid of failure. To build resilience, you have to put things into perspective and not get too caught up in the moment. In summary, patience is a virtue you acquire through experience, and resilience is a hard-willed quality that can be cultivated.\n",
